                <h2>My origins and culture</h2>
                    <p>I am originally from Angola, a former Portuguese colony in southwest Africa bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zambia.
                        In Angola, we speak Portuguese, which is the official language, a language that I do not speak, but I speak Lingala, the mother tongue of the Congo, because the Angolan and Congolese cultures are almost the same.

                    <h2>MY CHARACTER TRAITS AND PERSONALITIES</h2>
                    <p class="description naissance">If I were to define my character traits, I am a responsible, polite and calm person who does not like any form of tension, whether it is an argument or a fight...
                        I am curious and sometimes I can be clumsy. All these criteria, reflect the education that my parents taught me</p>

                    <p class="description naissance">I am a person who loves to practice sports. I played a bit of football when I was young, but I soon developed a taste for martial arts and practiced taekwondo, a martial art from South Korea, which allowed me to travel and participate in competitions.
